This project is meant to help players of Rise of Cultures to select the best wonders for certain situations.
It can be quite complex, because it depends on several parameters:
- Wonder levels
- Player play style and preferences
- The wonder type
- The total amount of the synergy wonder type placed in the grid
- The synergy multiplier (2 for Yggdrasil and Dragonship Ellida)

This project currently is:
- A PostgreSQL database
- A Python project


This project has just started!
